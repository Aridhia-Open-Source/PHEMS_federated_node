## Federated Node service for PHEMS project
The development of the PHEMS ecosystem will entail the design and implementation of federated analytics, algorithms, governance framework and an implementation playbook.

# Deployment

_Will be updated with the `helm add repo` once a build is created_
```sh
helm install federatednode ./k8s/federated_node
```

# Update
```sh
helm upgrade federatednode ./k8s/federated_node
```

# Run locally
Minikube is required.
```sh
./scripts/run_local.sh
```

This will launch a Minikube cluster called `federatednode`, and apply the helm chart with the default `values.yaml`.

Open the nginx port with
```sh
kubectl port-forward -n ingress-nginx svc/ingress-nginx-controller 443
```
Also add the custom host url to the hosts list
On Windows: `C:\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`
On WSL/Linux: `/etc/hosts`
```
127.0.0.1 host-url
```
